## 2024-12-14 - Session 2

**Worked On:** Phase 1 Foundation Complete

**Done:**
- Initialized Next.js 14 project with App Router
- Installed and configured shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Label components)
- Installed Supabase client libraries (@supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr)
- Created Supabase client helpers (client.ts, server.ts, middleware.ts)
- Created database schema migration (001_initial_schema.sql)
- Built Header component with FlywheelLogo
- Created landing page (/) with hero, 8-step flywheel, features, CTAs
- Implemented authentication pages (/login, /signup)
- Created OAuth callback handler (/auth/callback)
- Built protected dashboard page (/dashboard) with cycle tracking
- Added placeholder values for Supabase to allow local dev without credentials
- Fixed CSS @import order for Tailwind v4 compatibility

**How I Tested:**
- Ran `npm run dev` and verified all routes load:
  - `/` - Landing page with flywheel steps displays correctly
  - `/login` - Login form with Google OAuth works
  - `/signup` - Signup form with all fields works
  - `/dashboard` - Correctly redirects to /login when not authenticated (307)
- Ran `npm run build` - All routes compile successfully
- TypeScript passes with no errors

**Current State:** Complete - Phase 1 Foundation Ready

**Build Output:**
- `/` - Static (landing page)
- `/login` - Static (login page)
- `/signup` - Static (signup page)
- `/auth/callback` - Dynamic (OAuth callback)
- `/dashboard` - Dynamic (protected, server-rendered)

**Next Session Should:**
- Set up actual Supabase project and add credentials to .env.local
- Run database migration in Supabase
- Test full authentication flow with real credentials
- Begin Phase 2: Step 1 (Problem Discovery) implementation
